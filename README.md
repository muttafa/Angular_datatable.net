# Angular_datatable.net
This project is a project made using angular and datatable.net library.


Filtering operations and new record creation operations have been done in the project. it also has a pagination system and allows you to show as much data as you want on the page. there is no backend in the project, so your data will be lost when you close the application. but it is not very difficult to pull this data from the db with a simple web api and do other operations on the screen :)
